# SpaceBotNet: Spatial-Aware LLM for Multi-Modal Robotic Interaction in Public Space Design

## Overview

**SpaceBotNet** is a novel **spatial-aware large language model (LLM)** designed for **multi-modal robotic interaction** to optimize **public space design**. The project integrates machine learning paradigms such as **gradient-adjusted suitability refinement** and **cyclic optimization** to enhance decision-making accuracy and predictive stability in complex urban planning scenarios.

This repository contains the dataset, source code, and experimental validation results that demonstrate SpaceBotNet's superiority over traditional static frameworks in achieving **adaptive, inclusive, and sustainable** public space configurations.

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Integrates textual, visual, and spatial data to enable robotic interaction in urban design.
- **Adaptive Public Space Design Framework (APSDF)**: Incorporates **spatial suitability analysis, social affinity modeling, and ecological resilience**.
- **Dynamic Feedback Loops**: Ensures designs evolve with societal and environmental changes.
- **Gradient Optimization**: Uses **gradient-adjusted suitability refinement** for enhanced spatial decision-making.
- **Cyclic Optimization**: Improves predictive stability and adaptability.
- **Open-Source Dataset & Code**: Enables further research and development in spatial-aware AI and urban design.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SpaceBotNet.git
